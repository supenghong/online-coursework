This is how you start with a message (like a txt message, or an interplanetary space-probe photograph), translate it into a digital signal, and send it over a noisy communication channel. The hope is that you can reconstruct the message on the other end even if part of it is corrupted. It turns out you can reconstruct a damaged message if you include a few more bits, and are able to do a lot of math. This application is only slightly different from Cryptography, where you want to make sure no one can decode your message other than the intend recipient. Or maybe you want a better way of reading messages you are not supposed to read. The same principles of Finite Fields also form the foundation of things like Cryptocurrency.   \n",
